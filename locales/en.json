  "lms_ipsc_defi_titre": "The Challenge",
  "lms_ipsc_defi_p": "To create much more than a simple course store: to build the go-to bilingual reference platform for training in community social pediatrics (CSP). The challenge was to design a centralized ecosystem that integrates various learning modalities (e-learning, webinars, podcasts), fosters social learning through discussion spaces, and offers a personalized and intuitive user experience, while serving as a meeting place for professionals and strengthening the IPSC's credibility on a global scale.",
  "lms_ipsc_solution_titre": "My Solution",
  "lms_ipsc_solution_p": "Leveraging a robust WordPress ecosystem, I architected an integrated solution using LearnDash for course management, BuddyBoss for community and social learning features, and WooCommerce for training sales. A powerful automation system was implemented to handle administrative tasks and communications. The result is a centralized, scalable, and engaging platform with personalized learner profiles, a resource library, discussion forums, and a new dedicated research space, all presented with a clean design and an optimized content structure for quick access to information.",
